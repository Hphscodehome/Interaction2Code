    Step 1: Analyze the difference between the two screenshots. 
    Carefully compare the original and interactive screenshots of the webpage. 
    Identify any visual, structural, or functional changes that have occurred due to user interaction. 
    These could include changes in color, text, position, layout, animations, popups, new component and so on.

    Step 2: Locate the interactive elements. 
    Once youâ€™ve identified the differences, pinpoint which elements on the webpage were interacted with to cause these changes. 
    This could be buttons, dropdown menus, labels, input, image, link, text etc. 
    Specify the exact components and explain how they contribute to the interaction.

    Step 3: Implement the interaction. 
    Writing codes (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to implement the interaction.
    The interaction function should cause the difference you analyze in Step 1.
    Implement the interaction function on the interactive element you locate from step 2.
    Ensure the functionality matches what is observed in the second screenshot.
